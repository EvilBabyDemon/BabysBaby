My first Discord Bot!

A bot for specifically one server to moderate it a bit easier.

Moderation Tools like handling roles for the authentication part, role assignment before Discord did it themselves, warning and reports.

Command to remove non study related channels from your channel list to be hopefully more productive.

And a lot of other random commands that I just felt like implementing pretty much always to make my life easier.
